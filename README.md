# webapp_screen_generator

This lets you generate the HTML code for a simple "screen" using w3.css that can be used as the basis for a single screen web app. 

It makes no attempt to allow for every possible HTML element, just enough to make useful apps with limited choice. It is intended to create a start only.

The generated code that can be copy-pasted into the HTML file for a very simple single-screen webapp like the one I made for the tutorial at https://github.com/graded-cs-resources/simple-firebase-webapp-example
